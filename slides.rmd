## _Clostridioides_ - a new genus <hr/>

.pull-left[

- 2013: phylogenetic analyses suggest _C. difficile_ belongs in family _Peptostreptococcaceae_.

- Suggested name change: " _Peptoclostridium_ ". But believed drastic name change would create confusion.

- "The genus _Clostridium_ as presently constituted is phylogenetically and phenotypically incoherent." Restrict genus to _Clostridium butyricum_ and related species.

- Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) & US CDC adopted _Clostridioides_ as compromise. Retain " _C. difficile_ "!

# New IDSA Guidelines

## IDSA Guidelines <hr/>

.pull-left[

- Synthesizes lots of new data in field where basic science and therapies are evolving rapidly.

- Big changes!  

    - **New recommendation for diagnostic testing algorithm**.

    - **New recommendation for initial treatment**.

    - **New recommendation for recurrent CDI (R-CDI) treatment**.

# How to Diagnose _C. difficile_ : Toxin or Toxigenic Bacteria?



---


## Where have all my PCR tests gone? <hr/>

.pull-left[

- IDSA (& ESCMID) prefer multi-step testing:  

    - glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) EIA followed by toxin EIA, "arbitrated" by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)  
    - OR NAAT plus toxin EIA

- only use NAAT alone or (high-sensitivity) toxin EIA alone if can ensure high pre-test probability of CDI:

    - evidence that colonization among healthcare-exposed patients is common (NAAT too sensitive)
    - degree of disease tracks with quantity of detectable toxin

## Interpreting multi-step _C. difficile_ tests <hr/>

- Too many tests for _C. difficile_: common antigen / glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) EIA, toxin A/B EIA, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT, aka PCR), toxigenic culture (TC), cytotoxicity assay (CTA).  

- Question: do we want to measure presence of toxigenic bacteria, or level of toxin production _in vivo_?

- Current recommendation emphasizes <ins>measuring both</ins>:  

    - is there toxigenic _C. difficile_ present? GDH or NAAT
    - is there measurable toxin A/B? toxin EIA

- Clinical decision to treat depends on alternate explanations for diarrhea.  

- <mark>Beware the patient with only NAAT+ testing who fails to respond to anti-CDI antibiotics</mark>.




---

## Is ultrasensitive toxin testing the answer? <hr/>

- Colonization by toxin-producing _C difficile_ does not equate with disease (necessary but not sufficient)  

- Can we measure free toxin with greater sensitivity and specificity? (e.g., "digital ELISAs")

- Analytic challenges with validation:  

    - comparison test is cytotoxicity assay (CTA)
    - how does _ex vivo_ toxin production relate to _in vivo_ toxin production?  
    
- Clinical challenges with validation:

    - clinical diagnosis of CDI difficult to adjudicate
    - 5-log range of toxin concentration (0-1e5 pg/mL) in both CDI-NAAT and carrier-NAAT populations

## IDSA: initial and recurrent _C. difficile_ treatment <hr/>

- Initial CDI:

    - metronidazole only for mild disease, only if contraindication to VAN/FID
    - vancomycin dosing 125mg QID (regardless of severity)
    - though fidaxomicin first line, not preferred

- Recurrent CDI:  

    - prolonged, tapered pulse regimen of vancomycin
    - rifaximin "chaser" regimen: 400mg TID for 20d
    - fidaxomicin "chaser" regimens: standard 10d BID versus 7d DAILY then 26d QOD
    - <mark>the pulse is more important than the taper</mark>

---

## IDSA: fulminant _C. difficile_ treatment <hr/>

- Not much change:

    - enteral high-dose vancomycin
    - <mark>add rectal vancomycin in case of ileus</mark>
    - intravenous metronidazole

- Role for FMT? (case reports)  

- Role for bezlotoxumab?

- (Toxin binding polymers abandoned after tolevamer trial).

## Updates on Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) <hr/>

- The "backlash":  

    - March 19, 2019: OpenBiome nearly doubled prices
    - June 13, 2019: FDA safety alert regarding FMT-related sepsis and death
    - Xing Tang & Stuart Johnson editorial: "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for C. difficile infection, just say 'No'"

- Multiple companies with "ecobiotic" FMT alternatives in phase II/III trials:  

    - Seres, Rebiotix, Seres, Vedanta
    - FDA update planned after meeting November 4, 2019

- IDSA: "The opinion of the panel is that appropriate antibiotic treatments for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) should be tried prior to offering fecal microbiota transplantation."



.footnote[Tan X & Johnson S _Anaerobe_ 2019; McDonald LC et al _Clin Inf Dis_ 2018]

## Updates on Surgical Therapy for CDI <hr/>

- IDSA:  

    - "If surgical management is necessary for severely ill patients, perform subtotal colectomy with preservation of the rectum (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)."  
    
    - "Diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage followed by antegrade vancomycin flushes is an alternative approach that may lead to improved outcomes (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence)."  
    
- Trends in diverting loop ileostomy vs colectomy:  

    - annual proportion of patients undergoing only diversion increased 11.16% in 2011 to 25.3% in 2015
    - no significant difference in in-hospital mortality rate between the groups (retrospective cohort)

## Updates on Immune Therapy for CDI <hr/>



.footnote[Johnson S & Gerding DN _Clin Inf Dis_ 2019]


---

## Updates on Antibiotic Therapy for CDI <hr/>

- More precisely targeted therapy for _C. difficile_:

    - **cadazolid**: missed primary endpoint (non-inferiority to vancomycin for CDI clinical cure) in 1/2 phase 3 trials
    - **ridinilazole**: phase III trial in progress

- Gut microbiome protection:

    - oral beta-lactamase
    - activated charcoal
