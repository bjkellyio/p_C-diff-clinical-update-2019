## IDSA Guidelines <hr/>

_All the above observations suggest the possibility of a <mark>cellular-immune dysfunction related to a common exposure that predisposes individuals to opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis and candidiasis</mark>. Although the role of CMV infection in the pathogenesis of pneumocystosis remains unknown, the possibility of_ P. carinii _infection must be carefully considered in a differential diagnosis for previously healthy homosexual males with dyspnea and pneumonia._
