Management of C.difficile - 2017 IDSA SHEA guideline update
- initial treatment: vanco or fidaxo (over metro)
- dosage of vanco 125
- only metro if access limited and if mild-moderate C.difficile infection
(severity: clinical mostly; objective WBC > 15k, Cr > 1.5)

Why new first-line treatment?
- Teasley Lancet 1983, Wenisch CID 1996, Zar CID 2007, Johnson CID 2014, Louie NEJM 2011, Cornely Lancet ID 2012
→ vancomycin superior to metro for initial cure and sustained response
→ fidaxomicin equivalent with initial cure but superior with sustained response

FYI - Costco has negotiated a good price for oral vancomycin (90$ for 10-day course)

First recurrence C.diff:
- standard vanco, or vanco pulse taper, or standard fidaxomicin (weak recommendations)
- need more data in this area

More than one recurrence:
Pulse taper vanco; vanco course followed by fidaxomicin; or fidaxomicin
FMT recommended
again weak recs; need more data

Stuart Johnson -- the pulse seems more critical than the taper
(or use rifaximin chaser after standard vanco course)
(note: rifaximin has been associated with development of resistance)

Sirbu BD CID 2017: vancomycin taper and pulsed regimen with careful follow-up for CDI recurrence

What about FMT? Tan X, Johnson S Anaerobe 2019 (epub ahead of print)
Van Nood NEJM 2013
Cammarota 2015
Hota 2017 * stopped for futility at interim analysis; vanco pulse taper better than FMT *

Results are highly dependent on patient selection. FMT is not 100% cure; not the answer for everyone with C.difficile.

More cautions with FMT:
March 19, 2019 OpenBiome doubled its prices
June 13, 2019: FDA safety alert regarding FMT
November public hearing


Soriano MM OFID 2014: explored fidaxomicin to manage multiple recurrences -- fidaxomicin chaser versus fidaxomicin taper (200mg daily for 7d then qod for 26 days)
Remember fidaxomicin like vancomycin is not absorbed


Guery Lancet ID 2018: EXTEND trial - compare fidaxomicin 200mg bid then qod for 20 days versus standard course of vancomycin → very similar initial cure, but rate of recurrence reduced with EXTEND strategy

Who’s at “high risk”? 
Gerding DN CID 2018 - age > 65, prior CDI, immunocompromise, severe CDI
With no risk factors, no advantage
When do you administer the drug? Doesn’t seem to matter when during treatment it is given

Widespread practice of vanco prophylaxis for patients with prior CDI and subsequent antibiotic exposure:
Van Hise CID 2016, Carignan AJG 2016, Splinter A Pharm 2018, Caroff ICHE 2019, Knight J Pharm 2019, Zhang BMC ID 2019
Caroff prior R-CDI vs prior initial
Mixed back; guidelines avoided making recommendation
Individualized
Oral presentation on oral vanco prophylaxis


Summary:
Metro inferior to vanco, regardless of disese severity
Vanco and fidaxo equiv for initial cure; fidaxo superior for sustained response
Mananagement of multiple recurrences tricky; reserve FMT for > 2 recurrences
Extended pulse fidaxo and bezlo may improve outcomes

Stuart Johnson, Loyola & Ciaran Kelly, BID = update committee

Probiotics - not much discussion

Not much rationale for high-dose vancomycin in non-fulminant disease; only first few days of fulminant disease; may make situation worse (eradicate)

FMT for patients with fulminant CDI; acute severe ; two questions, no answers

Guidelines recommendation for “Pittsburgh” protocol diverting loop ileostomy

Level of metronidazole modest in the colon → interesting presentation tomorrow about metronidazole resistance
