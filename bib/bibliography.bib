              formers and other misplaced clostridia",
  author   = "Yutin, Natalya and Galperin, Michael Y",
  abstract = "The class Clostridia in the phylum Firmicutes (formerly low-G+C
              Gram-positive bacteria) includes diverse bacteria of medical,
              environmental and biotechnological importance. The
              Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa branch, which unifies members
              of the Firmicutes with Gram-negative-type cell envelopes, was
              recently moved from Clostridia to a separate class Negativicutes.
              However, draft genome sequences of the spore-forming members of
              the Negativicutes revealed typically clostridial sets of
              sporulation genes. To address this and other questions in
              clostridial phylogeny, we have compared a phylogenetic tree for a
              concatenated set of 50 widespread ribosomal proteins with the
              trees for beta subunits of the RNA polymerase (RpoB) and DNA
              gyrase (GyrB) and with the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny. The results
              obtained by these methods showed remarkable consistency,
              suggesting that they reflect the true evolutionary history of
              these bacteria. These data put the
              Selenomonas-Megasphaera-Sporomusa group back within the
              Clostridia. They also support placement of Clostridium difficile
              and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae;
              we suggest resolving the long-standing naming conundrum by
              renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile. These data also indicate
              the existence of a group of cellulolytic clostridia that belong
              to the family Ruminococcaceae. As a tentative solution to resolve
              the current taxonomical problems, we propose assigning 78 validly
              described Clostridium species that clearly fall outside the
              family Clostridiaceae to six new genera: Peptoclostridium,
              Lachnoclostridium, Ruminiclostridium, Erysipelatoclostridium,
              Gottschalkia and Tyzzerella. This work reaffirms that 16S rRNA
              and ribosomal protein sequences are better indicators of
              evolutionary proximity than phenotypic traits, even such key ones
              as the structure of the cell envelope and Gram-staining pattern.",

              difficile infections (CDI), and approximately 32\% of these
              infections are community-associated (CA) CDI. The
              population-level impact of antibiotic use on adult CA-CDI rates
              is not well described. Methods. We used 2011 active population-
              and laboratory-based surveillance data from 9 US geographic
              locations to identify adult CA-CDI cases, defined as C
              difficile-positive stool specimens (by toxin or molecular assay)
              collected from outpatients or from patients $\leq$3 days after
              hospital admission. All patients were surveillance area residents
              and aged $\geq$20 years with no positive test $\leq$8 weeks prior
              and no overnight stay in a healthcare facility $\leq$12 weeks
              prior. Outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions dispensed in 2010
              were obtained from the IMS Health Xponent database. Regression
              models examined the association between outpatient antibiotic
              prescribing and adult CA-CDI rates. Methods. Healthcare providers
              prescribed 5.2 million courses of antibiotics among adults in the
              surveillance population in 2010, for an average of 0.73 per
              person. Across surveillance sites, antibiotic prescription rates
              (0.50-0.88 prescriptions per capita) and unadjusted CA-CDI rates
              (40.7-139.3 cases per 100 000 persons) varied. In regression
              modeling, reducing antibiotic prescribing rates by 10\% among
              persons $\geq$20 years old was associated with a 17\% (95\%
              confidence interval, 6.0\%-26.3\%; P = .032) decrease in CA-CDI
              rates after adjusting for age, gender, race, and type of
              diagnostic assay. Reductions in prescribing penicillins and
              amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were associated with the greatest
              decreases in CA-CDI rates. Conclusions and Relevance.
              Community-associated CDI prevention should include reducing
              unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use. A modest reduction of 10\%
              in outpatient antibiotic prescribing can have a disproportionate
              impact on reducing CA-CDI rates.",

               hospitals. METHODS: Probiotic use among patients discharged in
               2012 was estimated using the MarketScan Hospital Drug Database.
               In addition, the annual trend in probiotic use (2006-2012) was
               assessed among a subset of hospitals. RESULTS: Among 145
               hospitals with 1,976,167 discharges in 2012, probiotics were
               used in 51,723 (2.6\%) of hospitalizations occurring in 139
               (96\%) hospitals. Patients receiving probiotics were 9 times
               more likely to receive antimicrobials (P < .0001) and 21 times
               more likely to have a Clostridium difficile infection diagnosis
               (P < .0001). The most common probiotic formulations were
               Saccharomyces boulardii (32\% of patients receiving probiotics),
               Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (30\%), L

              identify cases of C. difficile infection (stool specimens
              positive for C. difficile on either toxin or molecular assay in
              residents $\geq$ 1 year of age). Cases were classified as
              community-associated or health care-associated. In a sample of
              cases of C. difficile infection, specimens were cultured and

              the estimated number of deaths was 29,300 (95\% CI, 16,500 to

               Clostridium difficile-associated disease in the United States
               are increasing and that the increase may be associated with the
               emergence of a new strain of C. difficile with increased
               virulence, resistance, or both. METHODS: A total of 187 C.
               difficile isolates were collected from eight health care
               facilities in six states (Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey,
               Oregon, and Pennsylvania) in which outbreaks of C.
               difficile-associated disease had occurred between 2000 and 2003.
               The isolates were characterized by restriction-endonuclease
               analysis (REA), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and
               toxinotyping, and the results were compared with those from a
               database of more than 6000 isolates obtained before 2001. The
               polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the recently
               described binary toxin CDT and a deletion in the pathogenicity
               locus gene, tcdC, that might result in increased production of
               toxins A and B. RESULTS: Isolates that belonged to one REA group
               (BI) and had the same PFGE type (NAP1) were identified in
               specimens collected from patients at all eight facilities and
               accounted for at least half of the isolates from five
               facilities. REA group BI, which was first identified in 1984,
               was uncommon among isolates from the historic database (14
               cases). Both historic and current (obtained since 2001) BI/NAP1
               isolates were of toxinotype III, were positive for the binary
               toxin CDT, and contained an 18-bp tcdC deletion. Resistance to
               gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin was more common in current BI/NAP1
               isolates than in non-BI/NAP1 isolates (100 percent vs. 42
               percent, P<0.001), whereas the rate of resistance to clindamycin
               was the same in the two groups (79 percent). All of the current
               but none of the historic BI/NAP1 isolates were resistant to
               gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A
               previously uncommon strain of C. difficile with variations in
               toxin genes has become more resistant to fluoroquinolones and
               has emerged as a cause of geographically dispersed outbreaks of

              resistance in health care settings have evolved over time. When
              resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials mediated by
              extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) arose in the 1980s,
              targeted interventions to slow spread were not widely promoted.
              However, when Enterobacteriaceae with carbapenemases that confer
              resistance to carbapenem antibiotics emerged, directed control
              efforts were recommended. These distinct approaches could have
              resulted in differences in spread of these two pathogens. CDC
              evaluated these possible changes along with initial findings of
              an enhanced antibiotic resistance detection and control strategy
              that builds on interventions developed to control carbapenem
              resistance. METHODS: Infection data from the National Healthcare
              Safety Network from 2006-2015 were analyzed to calculate changes
              in the annual proportion of selected pathogens that were
              nonsusceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESBL
              phenotype) or resistant to carbapenems (carbapenem-resistant
              Enterobacteriaceae [CRE]). Testing results for CRE and
              carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) are also
              reported. RESULTS: The percentage of ESBL phenotype
              Enterobacteriaceae decreased by 2\% per year (risk ratio [RR] =
              0.98, p<0.001); by comparison, the CRE percentage decreased by
              15\% per year (RR = 0.85, p<0.01). From January to September
              2017, carbapenemase testing was performed for 4,442 CRE and 1,334
              CRPA isolates; 32\% and 1.9\%, respectively, were carbapenemase
              producers. In response, 1,489 screening tests were performed to
              identify asymptomatic carriers; 171 (11\%) were positive.
              CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that
              were CRE remained lower and decreased more over time than the
              proportion that were ESBL phenotype. This difference might be
              explained by the more directed control efforts implemented to
              slow transmission of CRE than those applied for ESBL-producing
              strains. Increased detection and aggressive early response to
              emerging antibiotic resistance threats have the potential to slow
              further spread.",

              represent a substantial reservoir of the bacteria and can
              transfer the bacteria to other patients. Hospital administrators
              are taking note of institutional CDI rates because they are

              (LTCF) residents with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or

              source of transmission in the LTCF and in the hospital during
              acute-care admissions. DESIGN: A 6-month cohort study with
              identification of transmission events was conducted based on
              tracking of patient movement combined with restriction
              endonuclease analysis (REA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
              SETTING: Veterans Affairs hospital and affiliated
              LTCF.ParticipantsThe study included 29 LTCF residents identified
              as asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic C. difficile based on every
              other week perirectal screening and 37 healthcare
              facility-associated CDI cases (ie, diagnosis >3 days after
              admission or within 4 weeks of discharge to the community),
              including 26 hospital-associated and 11 LTCF-associated cases.
              RESULTS: Of the 37 CDI cases, 7 (18·9\%) were linked to LTCF
              residents with LTCF-associated CDI or asymptomatic carriage,
              including 3 of 26 hospital-associated CDI cases (11·5\%) and 4 of
              11 LTCF-associated cases (36·4\%). Of the 7 transmissions linked
              to LTCF residents, 5 (71·4\%) were linked to asymptomatic
              carriers versus 2 (28·6\%) to CDI cases, and all involved
              transmission of epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strains. No incident
              hospital-associated CDI cases were linked to other
              hospital-associated CDI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
              that LTCF residents with asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile or
              CDI contribute to transmission both in the LTCF and in the
              affiliated hospital during acute-care admissions. Greater
              emphasis on infection control measures and antimicrobial
              stewardship in LTCFs is needed, and these efforts should focus on

              postdischarge sepsis controlling for potential confounding

              exposure was receipt of antibiotics more strongly associated with
              clinically important microbiome disruption. Our primary outcome
              was a hospital stay within 90 days of the index stay that

              Results: Among 516 hospitals, we randomly selected a single stay
              for eligible patients. In 0.17\% of these patients, severe
              sepsis/septic shock developed within 90 days after discharge. The

              for Clostridium difficile infection, it is less recognized how
              they predispose patients to typically foodborne pathogens such as
              Salmonella or Camplyobacter spp. While these pathogens account
              for only a fraction of traveler's diarrhea, such predisposition
              reflects how antibiotic exposure that precedes or occurs during
              travel may increase the risk for infection with other more common
              pathogens, even possibly enterotoxigenic Eschericia coli,
              especially in the setting of acquired resistance. Even short
              antibiotic exposures disrupt the gut microbiome up to a year or
              more and repeated exposures appear to attenuate recovery from
              ever occurring. One bacterial phylum that commonly increases in
              the gut following antibiotics are the proteobacteria including
              Enterobacteriacea; these are pro-inflammatory and often carry
              antibiotic resistance genes, the number and diversity of these
              genes (i.e. the resistome) commonly expands following
              antibiotics. The gut resistome among healthy community-dwelling
              adults reflects geographic variability in antibiotic use
              practices in both humans and food-producing animals as well as
              possibly the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes through
              the food supply. CONCLUSIONS: Because antibiotic use among
              travelers will influence the resistome and thereby promote
              geographic spread of resistance, it is important that antibiotic
              use recommendations for travelers be guided by resistance
              surveillance data as well as a careful assessment of the risks
              and benefits to both the individual and society.",

              composite samples were collected from each room; a third sample
              was collected from each Clostridium difficile room. Composite 1

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Globally, gastroenteritis is recognized as an
              important contributor to mortality among children, but
              population-based data on gastroenteritis deaths among adults and
              the contributions of specific pathogens are limited. We aimed to
              describe trends in gastroenteritis deaths across all ages in the
              United States and specifically estimate the contributions of
              Clostridium difficile and norovirus. METHODS:
              Gastroenteritis-associated deaths in the United States during
              1999-2007 were identified from the National Center for Health
              Statistics multiple-cause-of-death mortality data. All deaths in
              which the underlying cause or any of the contributing causes
              listed gastroenteritis were included. Time-series regression
              models were used to identify cause-unspecified gastroenteritis
              deaths that were probably due to specific causes; seasonality of
              model residuals was analyzed to estimate norovirus-associated
              deaths. RESULTS: Gastroenteritis mortality averaged 39/1000000
              person-years (11 255 deaths per year) during the study period,
              increasing from 25/1 000 000 person-years in 1999-2000 to 57/1
              000 000 person-years in 2006-2007 (P < .001). Adults aged $\geq$
              65 years accounted for 83\% of gastroenteritis deaths (258/1 000
              000 person-years). C. difficile mortality increased 5-fold from
              10/1 000 000 person-years in 1999-2000 to 48/1 000 000
              person-years in 2006-2007 (P < .001). Norovirus contributed to an
              estimated 797 deaths annually (3/1 000 000 person-years), with
              surges by up to 50\% during epidemic seasons associated with
              emergent viral strains. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenteritis-associated
              mortality has more than doubled during the past decade, primarily
              affecting the elderly. C. difficile is the main contributor to
              gastroenteritis-associated deaths, largely accounting for the
              increasing trend, and norovirus is probably the second leading
              infectious cause. These findings can help guide appropriate
              clinical management strategies and vaccine development.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Healthcare data suggest that the incidence and severity
              of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hospitals are
              increasing. However, the overall burden of disease and the
              mortality rate associated with CDI, including the contribution
              from cases of infection that occur in nursing homes, are poorly
              understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology, disease
              burden, and mortality rate of healthcare-onset CDI. METHODS: In
              2006, active public reporting of healthcare-onset CDI, using
              standardized case definitions, was mandated for all Ohio
              hospitals and nursing homes. Incidence rates were determined and
              stratified according to healthcare facility characteristics.
              Death certificates that listed CDI were analyzed for trends.
              RESULTS: There were 14,329 CDI cases reported, including 6,376
              cases at 210 hospitals (5,217 initial cases [ie, cases identified
              more than 48 hours after admission to a healthcare facility in
              patients who had not had CDI during the previous 6 months] and
              1,159 recurrent cases [ie, cases involving patients who had had
              CDI during the previous 6 months]) and 7,953 cases at 955 nursing
              homes (4,880 initial and 3,073 recurrent cases) . After adjusting
              for missing data, the estimated total was 18,200 cases of CDI,
              which included 7,000 hospital cases (5,700 initial and 1,300
              recurrent cases) and 11,200 nursing homes cases (6,900 initial
              and 4,300 recurrent cases). The rate for initial cases was
              6.4-7.9 cases/10,000 patient-days for hospitals and 1.7-2.9
              cases/10,000 patient-days for nursing homes. The rate for initial
              cases in nursing homes decreased during the study (P < .001).
              Nonpediatric hospital status (P = .011), a smaller number of beds
              (P = .003), and location in the eastern or northeastern region of
              the state (P = .011) were each independently associated with a
              higher rate of initial cases in hospitals. Death certificates for
              2006 listed CDI among the causes of death for 893 Ohio residents;
              between 2000 and 2006, this number increased more than 4-fold.
              CONCLUSION: Healthcare-onset CDI represents a major public health
              threat that, when considered in the context of an increasing
              mortality rate, should justify a major focus on prevention
              efforts.",

              measures are needed. Understanding the determinants of CDI
              incidence will allow for more meaningful comparisons of rates and
              accurate national estimates. METHODS: Data from active
              population- and laboratory-based CDI surveillance in 7 US states
              were used to identify CDI cases (ie, residents with positive C
              difficile stool specimen without a positive test in the prior 8
              weeks). Cases were classified as community-associated (CA) if
              stool was collected as outpatients or $\leq$3 days of admission
              and no overnight healthcare facility stay in the past 12 weeks;
              otherwise, cases were classified as healthcare-associated (HA).
              Two regression models, one for CA-CDI and another for HA-CDI,
              were built to evaluate predictors of high CDI incidence.
              Site-specific incidence was adjusted based on the regression
              models. RESULTS: Of 10 062 cases identified, 32\% were CA. Crude
              incidence varied by geographic area; CA-CDI ranged from 28.2 to
              79.1/100 000 and HA-CDI ranged from 45.7 to 155.9/100 000.
              Independent predictors of higher CA-CDI incidence were older age,
              white race, female gender, and nucleic acid amplification test
              (NAAT) use. For HA-CDI, older age and a greater number of
              inpatient-days were predictors. After adjusting for relevant
              predictors, the range of incidence narrowed greatly; CA-CDI rates
              ranged from 30.7 to 41.3/100 000 and HA-CDI rates ranged from
              58.5 to 94.8/100 000. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in CDI incidence
              across geographic areas can be partially explained by differences
              in NAAT use, age, race, sex, and inpatient-days. Variation in
              antimicrobial use may contribute to the remaining differences in

              inpatients METHODS: We used clinical data collected at the time
              of admission in electronic health record (EHR) systems to develop
              and validate a HO-CDI predictive model. The outcome measure was
              HO-CDI cases identified by a nonduplicate positive C. difficile

              inpatient admission. We fit a logistic regression model to
              predict the risk of HO-CDI. We validated the model using 1,000
              bootstrap simulations. RESULTS: Among 78,080 adult admissions,
              323 HO-CDI cases were identified (ie, a rate of 4.1 per 1,000
              admissions). The logistic regression model yielded 14 independent
              predictors, including hospital community onset CDI pressure,
              patient age $\geq$65, previous healthcare exposures, CDI in
              previous admission, admission to the intensive care unit, albumin

              $\leq$150 or >420 109/L, and white blood cell count >11,000 mm3.
              The model had a c-statistic of 0.78 (95\% confidence interval
              [CI], 0.76-0.81) with good calibration. Among 79\% of patients
              with risk scores of 0-7, 19 HO-CDIs occurred per 10,000

              occurred per 10,000 admissions (P<.0001). CONCLUSION: Using
              clinical parameters available at the time of admission, this
              HO-CDI model demonstrated good predictive ability, and it may

              value of the implementation of a multifaceted Clostridium
              difficile infection (CDI) control program at US acute care
              hospitals DESIGN: Markov model with a 5-year time horizon
              PARTICIPANTS: Patients whose data were used in our simulations
              were limited to hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries $\geq$65
              years old. BACKGROUND: CDI is an important public health problem
              with substantial associated morbidity, mortality, and cost.
              Multifaceted national prevention efforts in the United Kingdom,
              including antimicrobial stewardship, patient isolation, hand
              hygiene, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and audit,
              resulted in a 59\% reduction in CDI cases reported from 2008 to
              2012. METHODS: Our analysis was conducted from the federal
              perspective. The intervention we modeled included the following
              components: antimicrobial stewardship utilizing the Antimicrobial
              Use and Resistance module of the National Healthcare Safety
              Network (NHSN), use of contact precautions, and enhanced
              environmental cleaning. We parameterized our model using data
              from CDC surveillance systems, the AHRQ Healthcare Cost and
              Utilization Project, and literature reviews. To address
              uncertainty in our parameter estimates, we conducted sensitivity
              analyses for intervention effectiveness and cost, expenditures by
              other federal partners, and discount rate. Each simulation
              represented a cohort of 1,000 hospitalized patients over 1,000
              trials. RESULTS In our base case scenario with 50\% intervention
              effectiveness, we estimated that 509,000 CDI cases and 82,000
              CDI-attributable deaths would be prevented over a 5-year time
              horizon. Nationally, the cost savings across all hospitalizations
              would be \$2.5 billion (95\% credible interval: \$1.2 billion to
              \$4.0 billion). CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits of a
              multifaceted national CDI prevention program are sizeable from
              the federal perspective.",

              are underway; identification of patients at risk for C. difficile
              infection (CDI) is critical to inform vaccine trials. We
              identified groups at high risk of CDI $\geq$ 2 8 days after
              hospital discharge. METHODS: Hospital discharge data and pharmacy
              data from two large academic centers, in New York and
              Connecticut, were linked to active population-based CDI
              surveillance data from the Emerging Infections Program (EIP).
              Adult residents of the EIP surveillance area were included if
              they had an inpatient stay at a study hospital without prior
              history of CDI. The primary outcome was CDI by either toxin or
              molecular assay $\geq$ 28 days after an index hospitalization.
              Important predictors of CDI $\geq$ 28 days post discharge were
              initially identified through a Cox proportional hazards model
              (stepwise backward selection) using a derivation cohort; final
              model parameters were used to develop a risk score evaluated in
              the validation cohort. RESULTS: Of the 35,186 index
              hospitalizations, 288 (0.82\%) had CDI $\geq$ 28 days post
              discharge. After parameter selection, age, number of
              hospitalizations in the prior 90 days, admission diagnosis, and
              the use of 3rd/4th generation cephalosporin, clindamycin or
              fluoroquinolone antibiotic classes remained in the model. Using
              the validation cohort, the risk score was predictive (p<0.001)
              with a c-score of 0.75. Based on the distribution of scores in
              the derivation cohort, we divided the patients into low and high
              risk groups. In the high risk group, 1.6\% experienced CDI $\geq$
              28 days post discharge compared to 0.3\% among our low risk
              group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified specific parameters for
              a risk score that can be applied at discharge to identify a
              patient population whose risk of CDI $\geq$ 28 days following an
              acute care hospitalization was 5 times greater than other

              for poor outcomes; however, we cannot yet use this information to
              prevent adverse outcomes. METHODS: Stool was collected from 8
              long-term acute care hospital patients experiencing diarrhea and
              2 fecal microbiota transplant donors; 16S rDNA V1-V2
              hypervariable regions were sequenced. Composition and diversity
              of each sample were described. Stool was also tested for
              Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
              and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Associations between
              microbiota diversity and demographic and clinical
              characteristics, including antibiotic use, were analyzed.
              RESULTS: Antibiotic exposure and Charlson Comorbidity Index were
              inversely correlated with diversity (Spearman = -0.7). Two
              patients were positive for VRE; both had microbiomes dominated by
              Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 67\%-84\% of their
              microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic exposure correlated with
              diversity; however, other environmental and host factors not
              easily obtainable in a clinical setting are also known to impact
              the microbiota. Therefore, direct measurement of microbiome
              disruption by sequencing, rather than reliance on surrogate
              markers, might be most predictive of adverse outcomes. If and
              when microbiome characterization becomes a standard diagnostic
              test, improving our understanding of microbiome dynamics will

              infections increase patient morbidity and mortality and might be

              assessed health care-associated infections (HAI), including
              Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and the role of six AR
              bacteria of highest concern nationwide in several types of health
              care facilities. METHODS: During 2014, approximately 4,000
              short-term acute care hospitals, 501 long-term acute care
              hospitals, and 1,135 inpatient rehabilitation facilities in all
              50 states reported data on specific infections to the National
              Healthcare Safety Network. National standardized infection ratios
              and their percentage reduction from a baseline year for each HAI
              type, by facility type, were calculated. The proportions of AR
              pathogens and HAIs caused by any of six resistant bacteria
              highlighted by CDC in 2013 as urgent or serious threats were
              determined. RESULTS: In 2014, the reductions in incidence in
              short-term acute care hospitals and long-term acute care
              hospitals were 50\% and 9\%, respectively, for central
              line-associated bloodstream infection; 0\% (short-term acute care
              hospitals), 11\% (long-term acute care hospitals), and 14\%
              (inpatient rehabilitation facilities) for catheter-associated
              urinary tract infection; 17\% (short-term acute care hospitals)
              for surgical site infection, and 8\% (short-term acute care
              hospitals) for CDI. Combining HAIs other than CDI across all
              settings, 47.9\% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were
              methicillin resistant, 29.5\% of enterococci were
              vancomycin-resistant, 17.8\% of Enterobacteriaceae were
              extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, 3.6\% of
              Enterobacteriaceae were carbapenem resistant, 15.9\% of
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were multidrug resistant, and
              52.6\% of Acinetobacter species were multidrug resistant. The
              likelihood of HAIs caused by any of the six resistant bacteria
              ranged from 12\% in inpatient rehabilitation facilities to 29\%
              in long-term acute care hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Although there
              has been considerable progress in preventing some HAIs, many
              remaining infections could be prevented with implementation of
              existing recommended practices. Depending upon the setting, more
              than one in four of HAIs excluding CDI are caused by AR bacteria.
              IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Physicians, nurses, and
              health care leaders need to consistently and comprehensively
              follow all recommendations to prevent catheter- and

              $\leq$3 years of age in whom colonization is common but
              pathogenicity uncertain. We sought to describe pediatric CDI
              incidence, clinical presentation, and outcomes across age groups.
              METHODS: Data from an active population- and laboratory-based CDI
              surveillance in 10 US geographic areas during 2010-2011 were used
              to identify cases (ie, residents with C difficile-positive stool
              without a positive test in the previous 8 weeks).
              Community-associated (CA) cases had stool collected as
              outpatients or $\leq$3 days after hospital admission and no
              overnight health care facility stay in the previous 12 weeks. A
              convenience sample of CA cases were interviewed. Demographic,
              exposure, and clinical data for cases aged 1 to 17 years were
              compared across 4 age groups: 1 year, 2 to 3 years, 4 to 9 years,
              and 10 to 17 years. RESULTS: Of 944 pediatric CDI cases
              identified, 71\% were CA. CDI incidence per 100,000 children was
              highest among 1-year-old (66.3) and white (23.9) cases. The
              proportion of cases with documented diarrhea (72\%) or severe
              disease (8\%) was similar across age groups; no cases died. Among
              the 84 cases interviewed who reported diarrhea on the day of
              stool collection, 73\% received antibiotics during the previous
              12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Similar disease severity across age groups
              suggests an etiologic role for C difficile in the high rates of
              CDI observed in younger children. Prevention efforts to reduce
              unnecessary antimicrobial use among young children in outpatient
              settings should be prioritized.",

              advanced age and antibiotic exposures. We estimated national
              incidence of NH-onset (NHO) CDI and patient outcomes. Methods. We
              identified NHO-CDI cases from population-based surveillance of 10
              geographic areas in the United States. Cases were defined by C
              difficile-positive stool collected in an NH (or from NH residents
              in outpatient settings or $\leq$3 days after hospital admission)
              without a positive stool in the prior 8 weeks. Medical records
              were reviewed on a sample of cases. Incidence was estimated using
              regression models accounting for age and laboratory testing
              method; sampling weights were applied to estimate
              hospitalizations, recurrences, and deaths. Results. A total of
              3503 NHO-CDI cases were identified. Among 262 sampled cases,
              median age was 82 years, 76\% received antibiotics in the 12
              weeks prior to the C difficile-positive specimen, and 57\% were
              discharged from a hospital in the month before specimen
              collection. After adjusting for age and testing method, the 2012
              national estimate for NHO-CDI incidence was 112 800 cases (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 93 400-131 800); 31 400 (28\%) were
              hospitalized within 7 days after a positive specimen (95\% CI, 25

              6600-10 700). Conclusions. Nursing home onset CDI is associated
              with substantial morbidity and mortality. Strategies focused on
              infection prevention in NHs and appropriate antibiotic use in

  abstract = "The dramatic changes in the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile
              infection (CDI) during recent years, with increases in incidence
              and severity of disease in several countries, have made CDI a
              global public health challenge. Increases in CDI incidence have
              been largely attributed to the emergence of a previously rare and
              more virulent strain, BI/NAP1/027. Increased toxin production and
              high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones have made this strain a
              very successful pathogen in healthcare settings. In addition,
              populations previously thought to be at low risk are now being
              identified as having severe CDI. Recent genetic analysis suggests
              that C. difficile has a highly fluid genome with multiple
              mechanisms to modify its content and functionality, which can
              make C. difficile adaptable to environmental changes and
              potentially lead to the emergence of more virulent strains. In
              the face of these changes in the epidemiology and microbiology of
              CDI, surveillance systems are necessary to monitor trends and
              inform public health actions.",

              increasingly reported among healthy individuals in the community.
              Recent data suggest that community-associated CDI represents
              one-third of all C difficile cases. The epidemiology and
              potential sources of C difficile in the community are not fully
              understood. OBJECTIVES: To determine epidemiological and clinical
              characteristics of community-associated CDI and to explore
              potential sources of C difficile acquisition in the community.
              DESIGN AND SETTING: Active population-based and laboratory-based
              CDI surveillance in 8 US states. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records
              were reviewed and interviews performed to assess outpatient,
              household, and food exposures among patients with
              community-associated CDI (ie, toxin or molecular assay positive
              for C difficile and no overnight stay in a health care facility
              within 12 weeks). Molecular characterization of C difficile
              isolates was performed. Outpatient health care exposure in the
              prior 12 weeks among patients with community-associated CDI was a
              priori categorized into the following 3 levels: no exposure,
              low-level exposure (ie, outpatient visit with physician or
              dentist), or high-level exposure (ie, surgery, dialysis,
              emergency or urgent care visit, inpatient care with no overnight
              stay, or health care personnel with direct patient care). MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of outpatient health care
              exposure among patients with community-associated CDI and
              identification of potential sources of C difficile by level of
              outpatient health care exposure. RESULTS: Of 984 patients with
              community-associated CDI, 353 (35.9\%) did not receive
              antibiotics, 177 (18.0\%) had no outpatient health care exposure,
              and 400 (40.7\%) had low-level outpatient health care exposure.
              Thirty-one percent of patients without antibiotic exposure
              received proton pump inhibitors. Patients having CDI with no or
              low-level outpatient health care exposure were more likely to be
              exposed to infants younger than 1 year (P = .04) and to household
              members with active CDI (P = .05) compared with those having
              high-level outpatient health care exposure. No association
              between food exposure or animal exposure and level of outpatient
              health care exposure was observed. North American pulsed-field
              gel electrophoresis (NAP) 1 was the most common (21.7\%) strain
              isolated; NAP7 and NAP8 were uncommon (6.7\%). CONCLUSIONS AND
              RELEVANCE: Most patients with community-associated CDI had recent
              outpatient health care exposure, and up to 36\% would not be
              prevented by reduction of antibiotic use only. Our data support
              evaluation of additional strategies, including further
              examination of C difficile transmission in outpatient and
              household settings and reduction of proton pump inhibitor use.",
